# Introduction

The use of AiiDA for any computational code can be confusing enough at times, and a large portion of the documentation available is very broad in approach, so I've created this directory to both house
all of my submission scripts and hopefully provide an insight into some of the ways you can alter/accommodate other systems. 

## Disclaimer

I am **far** from an AiiDA expert, I know how to alter various parts of it to suit my needs and query for various pieces of data from my calculations. If you need a very specific piece of information, I'd 
suggest going to look at the [documentation](https://aiida.readthedocs.io/projects/aiida-core/en/latest/)
